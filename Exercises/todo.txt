NOTE: Some useful methods are described in cheatsheet.txt 
TODO:
1. Clone repository (done)
2. Create new branch <js_exercises_YOURNAME> (git branch <branch_name>)
2. Open examples and write a solution one by one
3. Run your solution using "node name_of_example.js"
4. If there are no errors then commit changes (remember to 'git add' and then 'git commit -m "Commit message"')
5. Push changes to remote (git push origin <branch_name>)
6. Switch to branch "solutions" (git checkout <branch_name)
7. Merge your branch into solutions and compare your results with a solution (git merge <branch_name>)
