// Write a JavaScript function to find the area of a triangle. 
// Use it to compute are of triangle with base and height of 2 and 3 and print it to console
// if parameters are invalid (e.g. negative) return undefined
// TIP: area of triangle can be computed as one-half multiplied by height multiplied by base of triangle 
function triangleArea(base, height) {
	var area;
	
	// compute area here
	
	return area;
}
// call function and print its result below:
